  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  
  <h2>A Place I Would Like To Visit</h2>
  <p>If I could visit any place in the world, I would visit the country, France. I would 
  visit France because I love the culture, different cuisine, and the variety of 
  architecture. I also want to experience the different lifestyles in each city there.</p>
   
  <h2>A Person I Admire (past or present)</h2>
  <p>One person that I admire dearly is Audrey Hepburn. She is more of a role model to me.
  If you don't know who she is, she was an actress was starred in many classic movies. For
  example, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Sabrina. I admire her acting and style. In Sabrina, 
  her character visits Paris, and from that movie, I loved France even more. She was a 
  humanitarian and I believe she won an award for that. Sadly, she passed, but I still
  admire her so much.
